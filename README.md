### Summary of the COVID-19 Dataset

#### **Background**
- The dataset originates from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Brazil recorded its first case on February 26, with rapid community transmission leading to overburdened health systems.
- The dataset was collected in the context of an overwhelmed health system, limiting SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities.

#### **Dataset**
- Contains anonymized data from patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR along with additional lab tests.
- Data are standardized to a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

#### **Task**
1. **Predict COVID-19 Positive Cases**:
   - Use lab test results from suspected cases to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
#### **Submission Expectations**
- Submit a comprehensive notebook detailing data preparation, model creation, and evaluation.
- Use the dataset provided or any other relevant data.
- This is not a formal competition, and the focus is on the process rather than strict metric evaluation.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Model Performance**: How well does the model generalize and perform in real scenarios?
- **Data Preparation**: Through analysis and useful visualizations.

#### **Additional Notes**
- Decision-making in healthcare is complex and reflected in the dataset's sparsity.
- Clinical and exposure data are not currently available, emphasizing lab results for model development.
- The challenge aims to develop a model useful for routine clinical care with commonly ordered lab tests.
